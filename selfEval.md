# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
During this past couple days i have jsut been trying to knock all my assignments out asap so i can have time for the rest of my day. I have been enjoying do this but i normally just forget about lunch doing this and ive realized that this is not a race so for the future im going to do as much work as i can before 12 and then i will eat lunch and get back to work
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
I would tell that 5 year old to bust out the books and come up with his own definition(Kidding). I would tell that 5 year old to compare a function to a recipe. Writing the function is like telling someone a peanut butter and jelly has 3 ingridients. But if he wanted to act on the function, he would have to declare it or actually start pulling out peanut butter, jelly, and bread!
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
My understanding of parameters and arguments are definitely still limited but i essentially am understanding them as place holders for different variables i would like to plug into my function in the future
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
I would just have to ask them if they know any different type of arguments like range or sum off the top of their head!
